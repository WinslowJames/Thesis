Since the purpose of the joint-model is to improve on inference that would be gained from either the survival model or the recurrent infections on their own, we want to demonstrate the results of each of those models on their own. 
\newline
Here, we present the formulation of a simple survival model using both an exponential and weibull form for the survival distribution. 
\newline
\section{Exponential Distribution}
\subsection{Overview} The exponential distribution is the simplest parametric model for survival time and assumes a constant risk over time. This is analagous with the more succint description of being a 'memoryless' distribution. This distribution is not influenced by the decided upon definition for time zero. 
\newline
\subsection{Formulation}
* pdf: $f(x) = \lambda e^{- \lambda x}$
* survival function: $S(x)= e^{-\lambda x}$
* hazard function: $\lambda(x) \equiv h(x) = \lambda , \lambda > 0$
* cumulative hazard: $\Lambda(x) = \lambda x$
* Expectation: $E[X] = \frac{1}{ \lambda}$
* Variance: $V[X] = \frac{1}{ \lambda ^{2}}$

\section{Weibull Distribution}
\subsection{Overview} The Weibull distribution is a two parameter family that results in the exponential distribution when the second parameter, $\gamma = 1$.
\subsection{Formulation}
* We denote $X \sim Weibull(\lambda,\gamma)$
* pdf: $f(x) = \lambda \gamma x^{ \gamma - 1}e^{- \lambda x^{ \gamma }}$
* survival function: $S(x) = e^{-\lambda x^{\gamma}}$
* hazard function: $\lambda(x) \equiv h(x) = \lambda \gamma x^{\gamma - 1}$
* cumulative hazard: $\Lambda(x) = \lambda x^{\gamma}$
* Expectation: $E[X] = \lambda^{-\frac{1}{\gamma}}\Gamma(1 + \frac{1}{\gamma})$
* Variance: $V[X] = \lambda^{-\frac{2}{\gamma}} \Big[ \Gamma(1 + \frac{2}{\gamma}) - \Gamma(1 + \frac{1}{\gamma})^{2}\Big]$
